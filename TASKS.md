# Tasks in progress

Only work that has started and is not finished — plus, listed apart, the problems
the author has asked to keep here until he takes them up. **When a task is
finished, delete its entry**, in the same commit. What was done lives in git and
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and so does the rest of what has never been started.

## Started, not finished

**An agent drives MiniHub from outside — in test, not pushed** — works end to
end (patches, plugins, notes, save, export, Splice's web page, quit). Its
commits stay local while the author tests it.
Plan: [plans/done/agent-channel.md](plans/done/agent-channel.md) (standby while
the author tests).
- Not seen yet: a Codex session starting from the session rules and the first
  session note in `../minihub-agent/` (applied 2026-09-13).
- Unexplained: Splice's Expression reads 0.85 through `parameters` while the
  saved plugin state holds 1.0.
- Not seen yet: Splice keeping its login across a restart, now that MiniHub
  launches outside Codex.
- Optional: an MCP wrapper, so Codex calls requests as tools.
- Gap: `set-binding` plugs no cable (Learn does, since 2026-09-14) and does not
  redraw an open bindings bar.

**Learning a knob in one window: the bindings bar docked under the plugin
editor** — 7 of 8 steps. The bar opens under every plugin window, follows it,
and arms Learn on any knob, cabled or not: the capture plugs the cable in the
Patch Bay, Clear unplugs it. A bound knob or fader shows where its parameter
stands and moves it under the mouse; a binding that does nothing for now (cable
pulled out, plugin not running) is drawn dashed. Since 2026-09-15 the bar is the
only place a knob is learned: the VST node's page has no bindings panel any more.
Seen with Dexed. Left: the documents, step 8 of the plan.
- Not seen yet: a capture from the bar, and the cable it plugs (it needs a
  gesture in the plugin).
- Not seen yet: the drawn knob following the plugin's own knob, or the MiniLab's.
Plan: [plans/active/bindings-bar-docked.md](plans/active/bindings-bar-docked.md).

**The Patch Bay's context menus** — still hand-built in `routingModule.js`;
`ui/contextMenu.js` exists and only the sequencer uses it.

## Kept for the author, not started

**Kilohearts plugins do not load** — added on the author's request, 2026-09-15.
kHs Gain, kHs Filter and kHs Reverb end in error: "setProcessing(true) failed".
`start()` in `native/audio-engine/src/plugin_host.cpp` accepts only `kResultOk`
or `kResultTrue` from that call; JUCE's own VST3 host also accepts
`kNotImplemented`. Which code these plugins return is not verified. A native
change: `npm run build:native` 0 errors 0 warnings, and the four test binaries.

**Massive X moves a parameter by itself, and Learn takes it** — added on the
author's request, 2026-09-15. In the author's session that morning, for the 36 s
after its window opened, Massive X reported a parameter moving about 23 times a
second with nobody touching it (`vstParameterTouched` in the startup log, at the
engine's cap of 30 per second), until a change of plugin state stopped it. Two
Learns armed during that stream ended after 50 ms and 30 ms, most likely on that
parameter; the third, armed once the stream had stopped, took the author's
gesture. The engine records a value only inside a gesture
(`native/audio-engine/src/gesture_learn_state.h`), so Massive X was opening
gestures of its own. Which parameter it was, and what starts the stream, is
neither logged nor verified.

**MiniHub.exe still names itself Electron** — raised 2026-09-15, the author's to
decide. The executable's version resource says "Electron" for the product and
the file description, "GitHub, Inc." for the company: `scripts/sync-dist.mjs`
stamps only the icon onto it with `rcedit`. Windows likely shows that name, in
Task Manager for one — not verified.
